            <p class="lead">By far the most time consumin tutorial i have completed (5 hours)</p>
            <p>As part of my Unity game development class i decided to complete this tutorial from unity\s website, since it was divided into only 9 videos, what i didn't know was that most of them was 30/60 minutes...
            From this tutorial i learned about audio mixing in unity, game manager system, and much more.. will only recommend this tutorial for people with patience, since its
            the videos are live recorded and very slow going!</p>
            <p>Check out the code at <a href="https://github.com/rpuls/unity-tank"><i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> Github</a> </p>
            <p>No download for this game due to file size. Contact me if you want it.</p>
