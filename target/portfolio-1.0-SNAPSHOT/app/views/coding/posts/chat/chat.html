            <p class="lead">This is a java chat server and client, made at cphbusiness computer science studies</p>
            <p>It is programmed to take in 2 arguments, host and port. I'm running the server on my own machine and testing the clients from the same
                machine, so I give "localhost 8080" as run argument. The clients are by default set with a localhost ip adress, so no need to change when
                connecting. I test with three clients and one telnet to demonstrate the chat system. In case you wonder telnet does not show what I type in
                but I write "LOGIN:TELNET" which is the login command in the protocol.</p>
