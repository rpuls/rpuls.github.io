            <p class="lead">My very first experience with publishing android apps.</p>
            <p>First I had to pay a 25$ fee in order to gain developer status at google play. As soon as I started the release process of my simple app, I realised that 
                I needed a lot of graphics. I took some screenshots and uploaded, then I went into photoshop and designed a quick app icon/logo
                and uploaded that too. I also had to save my logo as .png file to include it in the apk build, in sizes of 192x192, 144x144, 96x96, 72x72 & 48x48 pixels.
                Then I had to go through a lot of other stuff, such as selecting which countries my app should be available in, and also calculating age
            restriction based on some parameters. Next step is generating a "signed APK" which required me to set up a "keystore" on my computer and password
             encryption, so that other people cannot update my app, but only I have the rights to do so. It took me 3 different tutorials and almost 6 hours to learn how to publish
             an app to google play store, and how to update it. Very good experience that I would not have gotten from my studies.</p>
