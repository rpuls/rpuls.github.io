                    <p class="lead">Started as my android course exam project, but are much more now!</p>
                    <p>My girlfriend and I like to play Yatzy (or Yahtzee) when we go out for beers or coffee during the daytime.
                        Sometimes we forget to bring the score sheet block at home, but usually the cafés have a piece of
                        paper and a pen they will lent us. One day we were at a café that had neither pen or paper to offer,
                        my solution was to use my girlfriends phones "note app" and keep track of the score with that. Quickly
                        I realised that I quite easily and fast could make an app that looks like the scoreboard and be a
                        little more nice to use than the note app. Few weeks later I was going to Italy for a wine fair (vinitaly)
                        with some colleges, and to kill time in the airport and during the flight I managed to write the
                        entire "yahtzee sheets" app which I later renamed to Yatzy Sheets due to fear of trade mark rights
                        of the name "Yahtzee" owned by Hasbro. I started hard coding the layout as XML, but as my teachers
                        at cphbusiness requested I must include the anko libraries in order to get a decent grade in the
                        end of the course. I decided to continue the app development and use it for my exam project so I
                        rewrote the layout to be dynamically generated, which made it a lot easier to implement a "game setup
                        system" and add more players since each column of the score sheet is generated dynamically. To make
                        the app advanced enough to use as exam project I obviously had to implement more features that would
                        touch the curriculum. I added:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A SQLite database, and db controller that would save all scores of all played games</li>
                            <li>anko libraries to access XML id's easily, and keep the code simple and readable</li>
                            <li>String values in the "res" folder to support multiple languages in the app</li>
                            <li>A dialog fragment that will let the user setup a game with unlimited amount of players</li>
                            <li>A broadcast receiver that will watch the battery level and warn the user if it drops</li>
                            <li>At last I created a 3D dice rolling game in unity and implemented, this made me achieve top grade
                                for this exam project! I have a dedicated post about the unity part <a href="app/views/games/yatzy/yatzy.html#yatzy">here</a>!</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="lead">Anything else it does?</p>
                    <p>After the exam I continued the development because I really liked the project, and because I see potential
                        in an app like this. Later on I have wanted to gain experience with other fields of android development,
                        e.g. advertising in apps. Therefore I signed up a google adMob account and followed a tutorial on
                        how to monetize your app. Currently my app shows one banner ad in the game setup dialog, so I potentially
                        will earn a little revenue based on how many new games are started, since the ad will be shown once
                        every time someone press "start game". Another goal for future development of this app is to implement
                        a content provider that will share game state information between the two process (the 3D rolling
                        process and the android app itself), so that players will only be able to put points on the scoresheet
                        according to what they rolled with the dices.
