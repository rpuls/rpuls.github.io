            <p>A live demo is running inside the iPhone below, it might be a little "buggy" right here, since it is placed inside an ifram, 
                nested inside a ng-include directive, which is nested inside a ng-view directive. You can also visit 
                <a href="https://www.nbrog.dk">NØRREBRO ON THE GROUND</a> at the official website. All shops on the map is clickable,
                an uib-modal will pop up when a shop is clicked, displaying some details about it. Please scroll down below the iPhone demo
                to read more about this project</p>

            <p class="lead">By far my biggest "coding" project, involving school, work, free time & many people</p>
            <p>As part of the community in Nørrebro, VINTRO (the wine shop I currently work in) has designed a map of local 
                businesses and called it: “Nørrebro On-the-Ground”. It started as a business community in Nørrebro with more than
                350 shops. The map was printed on 25,000 A2 posters and are distributed in east and west. 4 newspapers 
                mentioned this map and since then, an app was sought by many, but never been developed. As part of my last case assignment
                and final semester project on 3rd semester at cph business computer science, I convinces my study group to do our own project instead
                of going for the assignment the school was giving. The teachers, and my study group quickly accepted my request so we were good
                to go developing this web application which would be very useful as a promotion tool for the shop owner,
                and for us as students we would make use of what we have learned from this semester, and nurture our skills while encountering a bunch of problems.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">So how is it built?</p>
            <p>
                The app has a front end written in HTML5, CSS including several bootstrap-like frameworks and stylesheets, some jQuery and JavaScript
                is used aswell, but we have tried to stick only to Angular.js to keep a convention! On the server everything is written in Java, we are
                using ORM (JPA) for persistence and are swithcing between several persistence units that makes it possible to run test on the in memory
                derby test database. For offline data maintenance I use a local instance of the online DB both are mySQL databases. As deploy server we
                are using a instance of Tomcat 8, 2 servers running on digital ocean droplets, and one running on AWS (amazon), we have a database running
                on amazon, and one running on digital ocean. On the server side we have implemented some pretty cool features, first of all we are using
                a highly secured REST api, users passwords is hashed, salted and we are of course using a very slow hashing algorithm. All REST calls have
                been secured by "user roles", and no personal vulnerable data is stored in plain text!

            </p>
            <p class="lead">Anything else it does?</p>
            <p>
                Another cool feature that we implemented is the "google auto updater" which I personally have spent many hours on and think is pretty cool!
                One of the learning goals of 3rd semester was to do api calls to extern services. The school assignment was based on api calls to a public
                flight service, but that didn't fit in our project. So we decided to try out google's "places api." By giving each shop a google place id we are
                able to iteratively update information about every shop, such as address, house number, zip code, city, email, website, phone number. The updater
                service will run once every day, but only for shops that haven't been manually edited. In case a shop owner want a specific email on his/her page
                then the google auto updater should of course not overwrite it the next day. The app also contain a 100% self written picture upload system
                that writes files to the server and also saves them as a data stream (blob) in the database, this was the biggest pain in the *** ever, and it is still
                not flawless. I don't think I will ever create another self written file upload service myself, at least not with java! ;)
