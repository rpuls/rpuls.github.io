            <p class="lead">Made in sketchup during high school design A class at Lyngby Tekniske Gymnasium</p>
            <p>The task given by the teacher was to design a "hang around place" for young people. This was one of our
                first sketchup design assignments. Luckily for me I had a decent amount of sketchup experience from before
                I even started highschool.

                    <p>This is a view of each floor in the building. First picture is the house seen from outside,
                    second pic is the top floor with roof removed, third pic is the main floor, and last pic is the basement
                    containing bathroom and smoking area. Yes this was designed just before all the laws about no smoking indoor,
                    back then it was quite common to still have inside smoking areas.</p>

                    <p>Closer shot at the hang around areas. The main floor is suited with a bar, a dance cage and
                        a tiny dance floor (the small bubble) containing a dj booth on the stage, 3 function one
                        sub woofers beneath the stage, and 3 function one monitors hanging. The top floor if more
                        of a chill area, and pretty self explaining.

                    <p>Using space wisely in a round building is not necessarily an easy task, I think I found
                        a decent solution for the basement.
