            <p>My friend Jacob who is a bike mechanic told me that they had got a CNC cutter at the workshop where he is employed. He told
                me that it could cut out any bike parts from 3d computer models. I then told him that I had some experience with 3d modeling,
                and we both agreed that it would be fun if I designed a bike part that he then would cut out in aluminum with the machine.
                Without knowing any "bike engineering" I just started drawing something I thought looked fun and different.
            </p>

            <p>The close up rendering is with inner light emission simulated. I'm not using a normal light source
                here, actually I built in a bulb shaped figure in the center, and gave the material light emitting
                property, so it simulates a "grainy" light bulb.</p>

                    <p> Different viewing angles, with the same rendering settings. Only using global light, no material
                        is emitting light, but the "gold" material has reflecting properties.

                        After doing all the design (which didn't take too long) I handed over the graphics to Jacob. He
                        was quite impressed and brought the pictures to work, but the guy managing the CNC machine didn't
                        allow us to cut the stem, because he thought it would brake off because of poor engineering, and
                        that it was way too thin to support the steering bar.
