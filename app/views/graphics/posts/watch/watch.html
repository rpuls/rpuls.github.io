            <p class="lead">Spent around 100 hours designing this wrist watch. Sketchup, kerkythea & vray.</p>
            <p>I have always had a thing for mechanics, end when it comes to accessories for men, watches are the shit if you ask me.
                A combination of hardcore mechanics and luxury jewelery for men, it just don't get any better. For a long time I have 
                wanted to design a wrist watch, and my brain have been loaded with ideas. One day while I was only part time employed
                and didn't attend any education I finally started the design process in sketchup. Since I have no experience in better
                mechanical engineering software I decided to go for skecthup even though the final 3d model never would work as a blueprint
                for eventually manufacturing.

                    <p>These three images is later on rendered in kerkythea, still a bit buggy somewhere but the "bronze" material
                        gives a much better idea of how I wanted it to look in reality. The tiny white "second" lines should be red
                        but for some reason kerkythea recognizes them as the same object as the numbers (05, 10, 15....55) In the second 
                        picture something looks a bit strange  between 11 and 12 o'clock, that is the reflection of the IES light source.

                    <p class="lead">This video was used as material in my application for the danish academy of fine art (the industrial calss)</p>
                    <p>I had to send in 4-5 "art pieces", could be anything from paintings and sculptures, to jewelery, clothes design or street art.
                        My application consisted of thee 3D designs properly rendered (this video was one of them) and 2 paintings/hand drawings. I had
                        some troubles creating a "gold like" material, so I decided to render the "gold" in yellow.</p>
