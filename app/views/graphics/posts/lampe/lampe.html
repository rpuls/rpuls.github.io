            <p class="lead">Made in sketchup and later on rendered with kerkythea</p>
            <p>This project was pury hobby, had nothiing to do with any school assignments, but ended up being part of my admission application for
                the danish royal academy of fine art. Luckyly it wasn't "artisic" enough so I never ended up in that school which I today are thankful for.
            </p>

            <p>The close up rendering is with inner light emission simulated. I'm not using a normal light source
                here, actually I built in a bulb shaped figure in the center, and gave the material light emitting
                property, so it simulates a "grainy" light bulb.</p>

                    <p>These thee renders is with only global light and no walls, the lamp it self is "turned off".
                        This gives you an idea of what kind of decoration it will be during daytime.</p>

                    <p>Same rendering settings as first image, but this one I moved the camera further away from 
                        the lamp to show what kind of "room light" it gives. You can easily see the light pattern on the 
                        grey walls.</p>
