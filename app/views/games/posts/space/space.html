            <p class="lead">My first experience with programming and greenfoot.</p>
            <p>This was my first greenfoot project, based on a school assignment.
                the task was to implement different oppenent, different levels, power-ups, shooting enemies, acceleration movement, score system and sounds. This is what I came up with, and actualy won the class competition for the best game. This was during the 1st semester an computer science studies at cphbusiness</p>
