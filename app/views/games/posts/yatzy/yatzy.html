                    <p class="lead">As part in my android <a href="">yatzy app</a> I developed a dice rolling game!</p>
                    <p>
                        What is a yatzy score manager app without a little sidekick of a dice rolling game? What if you lose a die down a sewer drain
                        in the middle of a game? Yes I fired up unity to build my very own dice rolling game for yatzy, and
                        I wanted to make it special by using simulated physics to roll the dices. In blender I created a
                        die model & a cup which i both imported to unity and made prefabs of. I added a special mesh collider
                        to the cup that would keep the dices from falling through the sides and bottom, since mesh colliders
                        are expensive and "bad practice" due to their level of complexity I came up with my own idea. I
                        went inside sketchup and created a very simplified version of the cup and sized it to fit inside
                        between the outer and inner walls of the graphical cup, I then used that model to generate a much
                        more simple mesh collider and positioned that model inside the graphical model so it is not visible
                        at any time.

                    <p class="lead">So how does it work?</p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted it to be unique. There is plenty of dice rolling app out there, but I don't think there is any other
                        than mine that uses simulated physics to roll the dices (correct me if i'm wrong). Each die has a rigidbody, a box
                        collider & a material that describes bounciness and friction etc. When the player press the roll button each die is
                        positioned inside the cup (still not active), then they are one by one rotated random(0-360) on each axis x,y,z and 
                        at last all of them are activated so the gravity applies and they will fall out of the cup and bounce when they hit the
                        collider of the cup, each other and the ground surface. In this way it is almost impossible to have to equal rolls,
                        at least extremely unlikely. Though it is a neat feature to have simulated physics it does come with some "consequences". 
                        Due to its relation to reality it does happen sometime that the dices will end up leaning on each other or even be on 
                        top of another die. The Yatzy and Yahtzee rules states that this is an invalid roll, and should be rerolled. Therefore i
                        implemented the "next player" button that resets the game.
