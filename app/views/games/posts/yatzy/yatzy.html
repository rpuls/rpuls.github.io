                    <p class="lead">As part in my android <a href="">yatzy app</a> I developed a dice rolling game!</p>
                    <p>
                        What is a yatzy score manager app without a little sidekick of a dice rolling game? What if you lose a die doen a sewer drain
                        in the middle of a game? Yes I fired up unity to build my very own dice rolling game for yatzy, and
                        I wanted to make it special by using simulated physics to roll the dices. In blender I created a
                        die model & a cup which i both imported to unity and made prefabs of. I added a special mesh collider
                        to the cup that would keep the dices from falling through the sides and bottom, since mesh colliders
                        are expensive and "bad practice" due to their level of complextity I came up with my own idea. I
                        went inside sketchup and created a very simplyfied version of the cup and sized it to fit inside
                        between the outer and inner walls of the graphical cup, I then used that model to generate a much
                        more simple mesh collider and positioned that model inside the graphical model so it is not visible
                        at any time.

                    <p class="lead">Anything else it does?</p>
                    <p>After the exam I continued the development because I really liked the project, and because I see potential
                        in an app like this. Later on I have wanted to gain experience with other fields of android development,
                        e.g. advertising in apps. Therefore I signed up a google adMob account and followed a tutorial on
                        how to monetize your app. Currently my app shows one banner ad in the game setup dialog, so I potentially
                        will earn a little revenue based on how many new games are started, since the ad will be shown once
                        every time someone press "start game"
